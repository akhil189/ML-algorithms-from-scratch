# ML-algorithms-from-scratch
My Implementation of Classical Machine Learning Algorithms from scratch using NumPy

The modules are at [ml-algs](https://github.com/akhil189/ML-algorithms-from-scratch/tree/main/ml_algs)

The following algorithms are implemented
1. Linear Regression with Normal Equation, Batch, Mini-batch and Online Gradient Descent with l1, l2 regularizations.
2. Logistic Regression
3. Support Vector Machines (soft-margin dual-form)
4. Support Vector Machines (hard-margin dual-form)

**Note: [This is work in progress]**
